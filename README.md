# Company Overview 
##  Background 

### **What is Cardano?**

Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform that combines technologies to provide a secure and sustainable decentralition for applications, systems, and societies to transact on. The platform is named after Gerolamo Cardano and the cryptocurrency after Ada Lovelace.

Cardano is a crypto platform organised as a (DAC) decentralised autonomous corporation. In a DAC the company is managed by its shareholders and the protocol rather than a hierarchical tree of managers.

It is the first fully decentralised cryptocurrency to be founded on peer-reviewed research and developed through evidence-based methods, developing on first and second generation technologiies development within the crypocurrency space. 

Cardano founders see it has being a humaniatrion project set out to introduce  decentralised financial infastructure into third world nations to provide those socitiies with the same privelages seen in first world nations. Specifically the companies sets out the achive the following mission: 

 >Cardano exists to redistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins – to individuals – and be an enabling force for positive change and progress.

### **When was Cardano incorporated?**

The Cardano platform began development in 2015 and was launched in 2017 by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum and BitShares. Hoskinson left Ethereum after a dispute with its co-founder Vitalik Buterin. After leaving Etherum Charles went on to co-founded IOHK (Input Putput), a blockchain engineering company, whose primary business is the development of Cardano, alongside the Cardano Foundation and Emurgo. 

## Who are the founders of Cardano?

### **Charles Hoskinson**

Charles Hoskinson is a mathematician, the former CEO of Ethereum, and the founder and current CEO of blockchain company Input Output (IOHK). Additionally, Hoskinson is the co-founder of blockchain projects Cardano and BitShares.

Hoskinson entered the crypto space in 2013 through Invictus Innovations, a company he founded with developer Dan Larimer to launch the BitShares network. Later in 2013, Hoskinson started the Bitcoin Education Project, an online school where he met fellow Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. 

This led to Hoskinson becoming one of the eight original co-founders of Ethereum. While still in the early stages of the project, Hoskinson and the group proposed clashing visions for the structure of Ethereum. Hoskinson argued the platform should be a for-profit entity with a formal governance structure while Buterin sought to make it a nonprofit organization that was open-source and decentralized in governance. Hoskinson characterized the dispute as a “boardroom brawl,” and departed from the project in June 2014.

Later in 2014, Hoskinson collaborated with former Ethereum employee Jeremy Wood to create IOHK. IOHK’s aim was to be a third-party development company that would assist companies, government entities and academic institutions in building cryptocurrencies and blockchains.

Ethereum split into two following a controversial upgrade in 2016, leading to the creation of Ethereum Classic. Hoskinson became one of the leading supporters of the platform, using resources and developers from IOHK to build up the cryptocurrency. Today, IOHK is primarily involved in its own smart-contract cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA), which aims to compete with Ethereum.

### **Jeremy Wood**

Immediately upon finishing his studies at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Jeremy Wood to Asia to persue his career. He lived in Osaka, Japan from 2008, and joined the cryptocurrency movement in 2013, becoming a founding member of the Kansai Bitcoin Meet-up. He soon became entranced by the potential of next generation blockchains and joined Ethereum at the end of 2013, managing operations. 

After leaving Ethereum, Jeremy consulted on cryptocurrencies before starting Input Output with Charles Hoskinson in 2015. He moved back to the US three years later and stepped down from his role as chief strategy officer in 2020. Jeremy believes that the future of fintech will progress only through experimentation and research, and by promoting collaboration between diverse groups and organisations.

## Major stakeholders of Cardano

Even though Hoskinson and Wood are the masterminds and founders behind the core principles and smart contract platform that make up Cardano, they do not own or operate the Cardano blockchain. The three controling stakeholders involved in the project are: 

* **Cardano Foundation** – Acts as a nonprofit, custodial entity for the entire project to help market and ensure security of the blockchain.
* **IOHK** – Founded in 2015 by Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood, this research and development company has helped with the design and engineering of the Cardano blockchain.
* **Embargo** – Acts as a large funding entity to financially support Cardano and assist with its development.








## How did the idea for Cardano come about?

In the early days of Ethereum, Charles Hoskinson, saw the need for a more standardised, and scalable blockchain. With his mathematics background, Hoskinson began thinking about more scientific ways to build a blockchain. During this time, Hoskinson connected with Jeremy Wood who was also looking to create a better blockchain and smart contracts platform. The two began to pursue cardano as it exists today.Cardano is a blockchain platform with more advanced features than any protocol yet developed.

As a whole, a need was identified that the protocol’s design should be geared towards protecting privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators. In doing so, Cardano was the first protocol to balance these requirement, pioneering a new approach for cryptocurrencies.

In addition, while the platform has been desinged with the intention of eabling it to evolve and adapt to changing needs. Consequently the protocol was designed so that it can be upgraded by way of soft forks, and by the installation of a treasury system that will ensure the sustainability of the protocol.

## How is Cardano funded and how much funding have they received?


### **Inital Funding Stage**

When Cardano initially launched, the network reserved 5 billion ADA for its three development teams. The currency debuted with a market cap of $600 million. By the intial release 1.0.1 on the 27th if September 2017, it had a market cap of $10 billion, and reached a value of $33 billion briefly in 2018 before a general tightening of the crypto market dropped its value back to $10 billion.

# Business Activities

## What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?


### **Transaction Crypto Currency and Value Store** 
Cardano is a digital coin that can be used to store value or send and receive funds. The cardano coin can be used as a transfer of value in a similar way that cash is currently used. This is not much different from other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and bitcoin, but ADA has other uses as well.

>*The ADA cryptocurrency runs on the cardano blockchain, a first-of-its-kind decentralised network, based completely on scientific and mathematical principles and designed by experts in the fields of cryptography and engineering.*

One of the core principles of cardano is its Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain protocol where ADA is staked to the blockchain to help stake pool operators successfully verify transactions on the blockchain. 
Cardano looks to solve many of the blockchain industry’s current problems, including:

* The use of mathematics to provide a provably secure blockchain that is less prone to attacks
* Separation of accounting and computational layers
* Creation of a secure voting mechanism for token holders
* A consensus mechanism that is infinitely scalable

### **Smart Contracts and Decentralised Applications** 

The cardano blockchain can be used to build smart contracts, and in turn, create decentralized applications and protocols. Additionally, the ability to send and receive funds instantly through, for minimal fees, have many applications in the world of business and finance. Cardano looks set to launch a smart contract ability, the Goguen Mainnet, by 2021.

### **Regulatory Compliance** 

Instead of attempting to thwart global regulators, cardano is building a blockchain with regulation in mind, to provide financial services to all.




## What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or can not offer? 


### **Reduced transactional fees**

Cardano uses a Ouroboros - Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus so is more efficient to keep the network running and whilst not jeopdiding network securityh. This also allows for a high network throughput which allows processing high volume transactions with low fees. 

In comparison with Proof of Work (PoW) protocols, it is expensive to keep them running since it is necessary to pay for the electricity and they have low network throughput. As a result, transactions are slow and expensive. 

### **Reduced Power requirements and Environmental Impact**

The biggest benefit of Ouroboros is its mathematical security in choosing blockchain validators. Other blockchains claim they choose block validators at random. Ourboros offers a provable way to randomly select a validator and ensure all token holders who stake ADA to the cardano blockchain have a fair chance of mining a block and receiving the associated reward. 

This eliminates any need for excessive computational power prevalent in proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain networks and guarantees an objectively fair staking model that is not found in any other PoS blockchain protocol. The result, a signficanly reduced power usage and a less environmental impact. 

### **Eco-system Voting**

There is also the use of ADA in voting. In cardano, unlike other blockchain projects, it is not miners that vote and decide on changes to the protocol, it is token holders. Therefore, when a new change or development is proposed to the cardano blockchain, cardano crypto holders use their ADA to vote on these proposals. This way, everyone who owns the cryptocurrency has a say in its development.


### **Cross Platform Transactions and Smart Contracts**

In the future, Cardano will also be used to power the smart contract platform on the cardano blockchain. Developers will utilize ADA to create smart contracts and applications that run on the secure, decentralized cardano blockchain. Cardano will allow for these transactions to take place across mulitple platforms including Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens.




## Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?



### **Block Chain**

Cardono, like all other cryptocurrencies utlises blockchain technology. A blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions across a peer-to-peer network. Using this technology, participants can confirm transactions without a need for a central clearing authority. Potential applications can include fund transfers, settling trades, voting, and many other issues.


### **Proof of Stake**

Cardano works on a specially designed proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain protocol for consensus called Ouroboros. This consensus mechanism allows for ADA to be sent and received easily and securely at all times, while also ensuring the safety of smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. At the same time, as a PoS consensus mechanism, Ourboros provides rewards to token holders who stake their ADA to the network and help ensure network consensus.

The Ourboros process works in the follow steps:  

1. The network randomly selects a few nodes to have the opportunity for mining new blocks. These nodes are known as slot leaders.
2. The blockchain is split into slots, each of which is called an epoch.
3. Slot leaders have the ability to mine their specific epoch, or subpartition of an epoch. Any participant who helps mine an epoch or part of an epoch receives a reward for their services.
4. An epoch can be partitioned infinitely. This means, the cardano blockchain is, in theory, infinitely scalable, making it possible to run as many transactions as needed without hitting a bottleneck.

### **Multi Layer Approach**

The cardano blockchain consists of two core components. The Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL) acts as a unit of account and is where token holders can send and receive ADA instantaneously with minimal transaction fees. The Cardano Computational Layer (CCL) is a set of protocols which is the backbone of the blockchain, and helps to run smart contracts, ensure security and compliance, and allow for other advanced functionality, such as blacklisting and identity recognition. The cardano open source code is written using Haskell, a universally recognized and secure programming language.

Cardano’s multi layer protocol performs advanced functions, and has at its foundation a settlement layer that is elegantly linked to a control layer. The settlement layer will have a unit of account, while the control layer will run smart contracts. The control layer will be programmed to recognise identity, assisting compliance and allowing blacklisting for instance.


### **Daedalus wallet** 


Unlike other major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum, cardano has its own wallet for the ADA cryptocurrency. With the Daedalus wallet, users don’t just get a wallet, they run a full blockchain node, giving them total control over their funds and the ability to ensure transparency over the Cardano blockchain.

Additionally, Daedalus serves as the only wallet where ADA holders can take part in the Cardano staking system. Because Cardano operates a PoS blockchain protocol as previously mentioned, token holders can receive rewards for either delegating ADA, or running a staking pool within the Daedalus wallet. This gives cardano (ADA) holders the opportunity to earn cryptocurrency while supporting the network.


# Landscape
## What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

### **Decentralised Finance (Defi)**

Cardano operates within the cryptocurrency space, however more so within the decentralised finance landscape as it is developing itself more than a transational token and more of a finance infrastructure provider. The DeFi industry is about connecting these gaps, and making finance accessible to everyone without any form of censorship or financial intermediaries. DeFi opens up huge windows of opportunities and allows users to access various financial instruments without any restriction on race, religion, age, nationality or geography.

Decentralized Finance or DeFi is the movement that allows users to utilize financial services such as borrowing, lending, and trading without the need to rely on centralized entities. These financial services are provided via Decentralized Applications (Dapps), in which a majority of
them are deployed on the Ethereum platform.

## What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

### **Payment and Clearance System**

Traditional Payment and Clearance system have been challaned by cryptocurrencies that powers the DeFi movement whihc has allowed intermediaries to be by-passed. The speed at which these tranditional means of transacting occurs have substnatially improved. For example, the transfer of cryptocurrencies to any account in the world would take anywhere etween 15 seconds to 5 minutes depending on several factors, along with a small fee. 

### **Accessibility**

DeFi represents a movement that seeks to push borderless, censorship-free and accessible inancial products for all. DeFi protocols do not discriminate and levels the playing field for everyone and as such has improved accessability to third world nations. Traditionally, a user would require to have an exisiting bank account and access to a bank or transactional facility. Utilising crypotcurrencies, users are only required to have a compatible wallet in place, reducing the barrier to entry to a "mobile phone".

### **Centralization & Transparency**
Centralisation and transparency has been disrupted the most over the last 5 years. Without the need to transct through banks or credit untions, this new technology not only improves the currently performance of traditional systems, but it also removes the requirement for a centralised financial system. Additionaly, transparecy of transactions and other metadata is kept private, reducing the ability for Governments and third party to access transactional information. 

## What are the other major companies in this domain?

1. Ethereum
2. Uniswap 
3. Chain Link 
4. Pancake 





# Results

## What has been the business impact of this company so far?

The success of Cardano will be a gradual process of adoption. We will see commercial usage and probably many attempts to build something useful. IOHK and Cardano Foundation teams work on adoption mainly in developing countries. Many investors are impatient and judge the project just by the current price. It is very misleading. At the moment, Cardano is just in front of launching the main-net. If Cardano will be socially valuable then the price will reflect it. It is just about the adoption of technology. In the case of Cardano, there is definitely something to adopt. But people and time have to decide.


## How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Development timeline. Much of the Cardano network is still under development. Cardano’s Basho release to manage scaling issues could be months (if not years) away.

Second-mover disadvantage. Ethereum already has a strong first-mover advantage in NFTs; Cardano developers will need to work quickly on the Goguen release before Ethereum pulls away any further.

Cryptocurrency risk. All cryptocurrencies involve systemic risk. They’re fundamentally worth zero and only have value because other people say they do.

That means investors should spread their bets across multiple asset classes and coins. Even the top cryptocurrencies could fall to zero if interest in them fades.
